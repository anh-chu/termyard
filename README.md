# Termyard

Every tmux session and every coding agent, in one browser tab.

Know the moment an agent needs you.

---

You run coding agents in tmux. One window has Claude churning through a refactor, another has Codex waiting on a tool approval you forgot about, a third finished ten minutes ago and you never noticed. The work is spread across panes, windows, and sometimes machines, and you find out what each agent is doing by switching to it and looking.

Termyard parks all of that in one place. It renders your live tmux sessions in the browser and watches the agents running inside them, so a glance tells you which ones are working, which are stuck waiting, and which are done. When one needs your attention, it tells you, even if the tab is in the background.

<!-- TODO: drop a dashboard screenshot or GIF here once captured, e.g. ![Termyard dashboard](docs/brand/dashboard.png) -->

## Highlights

- **Agent status at a glance.** See which agents are active, waiting for input, or errored across every session, without switching to each one.
- **Push notifications.** Get a browser or desktop alert when an agent needs you, including when the tab is closed or you are signed out.
- **Multi-machine.** Connect any number of Termyard nodes through the dashboard. Sessions on every machine show up in one view.
- **The real terminal, in the browser.** PTY-backed xterm.js rendering means you get the exact terminal: borders, splits, colors, scrollback. Type, scroll, and resize like you are local.
- **Live session discovery.** Sessions, windows, and panes update in real time through tmux control mode.
- **Quick switcher.** `Ctrl+K` to jump between sessions and windows. Your hands never leave the keyboard.
- **One binary.** Go backend with the React frontend embedded. No separate processes, no Node runtime in production.

## Install

### Quick install

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.termyard.sh | sh
```

Detects your platform, downloads the latest release, and drops `termyard` in `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if that is not writable). Pin a version with `VERSION=v0.1.0 curl -sSL https://get.termyard.sh | sh`.

### With dist

[dist](https://github.com/ekristen/distillery) installs from GitHub releases with checksum verification and multi-version support.

```bash
dist install anh-chu/termyard
```

### From source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25+ and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard.git
cd termyard
make build
# Binary lands at ./dist/termyard
```

## Quickstart

### 1. Start the server

Make sure [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is running with at least one session, then:

```bash
termyard server
```

Open `http://localhost:7654`. On first launch you set a password, then Termyard walks you through agent setup.

Termyard serves plain HTTP. For remote access, put it behind a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx) or an overlay network like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) or WireGuard. Those layers also give you encryption. See the [FAQ](#faq) below.

### 2. Wire up your agents

Agents report their status through hooks, so they need configuring once per machine:

```bash
termyard agent-setup
```

This detects which agents you have installed and configures each one:

- **Claude Code**: hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Codex**: lifecycle hooks in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, enabled by `hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- **OpenCode**: plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/termyard.js`
- **Pi**: extension at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/termyard.ts`

Check hook status any time under **Settings → Agents**, or at `/setup`. For manual setup, see [docs/agent-setup.md](docs/agent-setup.md).

Useful flags: `--dry-run` previews changes without writing, `--config-dir agent=path` targets a non-default config location, `--block` lets hook failures surface instead of being ignored.

### 3. Day to day

Once hooks are in place, status shows up on its own:

- The **Overview** lists every session and surfaces any agent that needs attention.
- The **sidebar** shows each session with its task and the agent's latest message, plus status badges for active, waiting, and errored agents.
- **Push notifications** alert you when an agent needs input, even with the tab closed. Enable them under **Settings → Notifications**.
- **Splits**: drag a session onto another to tile them side by side, or drop on an edge to pick orientation. `Ctrl+Shift+\` splits the active pane into a new session.
- **Quick switcher** (`Ctrl+K`) jumps between sessions and windows.

## Multiple machines

Termyard nodes are symmetric. Every machine runs the same `termyard server`, and any node can connect to any other.

On each machine you want in the mesh, run `termyard server`, open its dashboard, and set a password. Then from machine **A**:

1. Go to **Settings → Machines → Connect to another machine**.
2. Enter machine **B**'s address (for example `devvm-b.local:7654`) and **B**'s dashboard password.
3. Leave **Auto-reconnect** on and click **Connect**.

A and B now share sessions both ways. You run Connect once per pair, from whichever side can reach the other. The reverse direction is automatic.

A dropped link auto-recovers within 30s using exponential backoff. Toggle **Auto-reconnect** off to stop dialing without forgetting the peer, or click **Forget** to remove it entirely. Pairing is not transitive: linking A to B and A to C does not let B see C. Pair B and C directly for that.

See [docs/multi-host.md](docs/multi-host.md) for reachability tips (NAT, Tailscale, reverse proxy).

## How it works

```
Browser  <──WebSocket──>  Go Server  <──PTY──>  tmux attach-session
                              │
                              ├── Control mode (real-time state changes)
                              ├── Session discovery (polling fallback)
                              ├── Tool event tracker (agent status)
                              └── Unix socket (local CLI notifications)
```

Each browser tab gets its own PTY process running `tmux attach-session`. tmux does all the rendering natively, and Termyard bridges the PTY output to xterm.js over a WebSocket. Switching windows runs tmux `select-window`, and tmux re-renders through the existing connection.

State changes (new sessions, window renames, pane activity) come in over tmux control mode and broadcast to every connected client on a separate WebSocket.

### Session status

Sessions show as **active** or **idle**, driven by tmux's `pane_current_command`:

- **Active**: at least one pane has a foreground process that is not a shell, for example `vim`, `claude`, `node`, `python`, or `go build`.
- **Idle**: every pane sits at a shell prompt (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `sh`, `dash`, `ksh`, `csh`, `tcsh`, `tmux`, `login`).

### Alerts

Alerts surface when an agent needs attention. They appear in the banner at the top of every page and in **Pending Alerts** on the overview.

- **Waiting**: the agent is waiting on user input, such as a tool approval in Claude Code.
- **Error**: the agent hit an error.
- **Active**: the agent is running normally, shown as a sidebar badge rather than an alert.

Alerts are live server state. They always reflect the current status and survive refreshes. Dismissing one hides it from the UI without touching the agent. Push alerts run independently of the tab, including when it is closed or you are logged out.

| Variable                      | Default                 | Description                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `TERMYARD_PORT`               | `7654`                  | HTTP server port                   |
| `TERMYARD_SOCKET`             | auto                    | Unix socket path for local CLI     |
| `TERMYARD_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL` | `2`                     | Session polling interval (seconds) |
| `TERMYARD_NO_CONTROL_MODE`    | `false`                 | Disable tmux control mode          |
| `TERMYARD_URL`                | `http://localhost:7654` | Server URL for notify/agent-setup  |
| `TERMYARD_NO_AUTH`            | `false`                 | Disable authentication             |
| `TERMYARD_NO_RECOVERY`        | `false`                 | Disable tmux crash recovery loops  |

### CLI flags

```
termyard server [flags]
  -p, --port int                  HTTP server port (default 7654)
      --discovery-interval int    Session discovery interval in seconds (default 2)
      --no-control-mode           Disable tmux control mode (use polling only)
      --socket string             Unix socket path (auto-detected if omitted)
      --no-auth                   Disable authentication (not recommended for remote access)
      --no-recovery               Disable tmux crash recovery loops
```

Multi-host peering is configured in the dashboard (**Settings → Machines**). Peer records live in `~/.config/termyard/peers.json` and are managed entirely by the UI. There are no `--hub` or `--tls-*` flags and no `termyard pair` or `termyard peers` commands. See [docs/multi-host.md](docs/multi-host.md).

### Run as a service

Install Termyard as a user service so it starts on login (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS):

```bash
termyard install     # install and start the service
termyard uninstall   # remove it
```

### Updating

```bash
termyard update                 # update to the latest release
termyard update --check         # check without installing
termyard update --version v0.2.0
```

### Keyboard shortcuts

Press `Ctrl+/` (or `Cmd+/` on macOS) for the full list, or click the `?` in the status bar.

| Shortcut | Action                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+K` | Quick switcher, jump between sessions and windows        |
| `Ctrl+J` | Jump to next alert (cycles through waiting/error agents) |
| `Ctrl+H` | Overview                                                 |
| `Ctrl+,` | Settings                                                 |
| `Ctrl+\` | Toggle sidebar                                           |
| `Ctrl+L` | Lock / sign out                                          |
| `Ctrl+/` | Keyboard shortcuts help                                  |

### Manual notifications

Send status updates from scripts or the command line. Session, window, and pane are auto-detected when run inside tmux:

```bash
termyard notify -t claude -s waiting -m "Needs approval"
termyard notify -t codex -s active
termyard notify -t claude -s completed
```

More flags carry session context for hooks: `--user-prompt` (the user's first message, set once, becomes the task label), `--agent-message` (the agent's latest reply), `--stdin` and `--event-data` (read a hook payload as JSON), `--agent-session-id`, plus `--session` / `--window` / `--pane` to override tmux auto-detection.

### Copying text from the terminal

The terminal captures mouse events, so a normal click and drag selects text inside tmux instead of copying. Hold a modifier while selecting to copy to the system clipboard:

| Platform         | Select to copy                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**        | Hold `Option` and drag to select, then `Cmd+C` to copy                                                                      |
| **Linux**        | Hold `Shift` and drag to select, then `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy                                                                |
| **iOS (Safari)** | Touch-select does not work in the terminal. Connect a mouse or trackpad, use `Option`+drag, then copy from the context menu |

This is standard xterm.js behavior. The modifier tells the browser to handle the selection instead of sending mouse events to tmux.

### Lock and sign out

Click the lock in the status bar (or `Ctrl+L`) to sign out. Auto-lock after idle is configurable under **Settings → Security**, including a shorter timeout when the tab is backgrounded.

## FAQ

### How do I get HTTPS or remote access?

Termyard serves plain HTTP and the peer link runs over plain WebSocket. For encryption or cross-network reach, put one of these in front of it:

- **Tailscale / WireGuard**: stable hostnames, end-to-end encryption, no proxy config. Recommended.
- **Reverse proxy**: Caddy or nginx terminating TLS in front of `localhost:7654`.

There is no built-in TLS termination or certificate generation.

### Can I run Termyard without a password?

Yes, with `--no-auth`. Only safe on a trusted local network or behind a reverse proxy that handles auth. Peer bootstrap requires a password, so multi-host peering is disabled when `--no-auth` is set.

### What happens if a peer goes offline?

Local sessions keep working. The peer's sessions stay visible (marked offline) for 5 minutes, then get pruned. Auto-reconnect retries in the background, and the link recovers within backoff (max 30s) when the peer returns.

### How do I forget a paired machine?

Open **Settings → Machines**, find the machine, and click **Forget**. The forget message propagates over the live link so both sides clean up. If the link is already down, the remote eventually hits "unknown peer" on its next dial. Forget it on that side too.

## Non-goals

- **Multi-user.** Termyard is single-user. One person, one dashboard. No accounts, roles, or shared access controls.
- **Agent orchestration.** Termyard does not start, stop, or control your agents. It watches and reports. You run agents however you like.
- **tmux management.** Termyard does not configure your tmux. Your `.tmux.conf`, layouts, and workflows stay yours.

## Development

```bash
# Frontend dev server (hot reload)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev

# Go server (watches for tmux changes)
go run . server
```

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Go, chi v5, gorilla/websocket, creack/pty
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, xterm.js
- **Build:** Single binary with `//go:embed`, GoReleaser for releases
