## [4.0.5] — Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes

- **peer:** keep the hub<->host data connection alive on idle remote terminals. `SpliceConns` answered the browser heartbeat ping locally but never forwarded it to the peer data conn, so NAT/proxy idle timeouts silently killed idle remote tabs and forced a visible reconnect flap. The ping is now replied to locally (fast ack) AND forwarded to the peer conn so the host echoes a pong back through the data->browser pump, keeping the link bidirectionally busy.
- **state:** unblock killing the last session on non-systemd hosts (e.g. macbook). `UpdateSessions` Guard 1 skipped every refresh where discovery returned empty while sessions were tracked, assuming all empty discoveries are transient — so a genuinely dead last session lingered as "disconnected — reconnecting" forever. Added `pty.Registry.IsSessionDead` (true for cleanly_ended / termination_requested / dismissed from the durable LifecycleStore) and taught Guard 1 to remove sessions when every vanished session is individually confirmed dead.
- **frontend:** prune dead session panes when the live session list becomes empty. The prune effect bailed on `sessions.length === 0`, so the dead pane stayed mounted and showed "disconnected — reconnecting". Safe because the backend Guard 1 keeps `/api/sessions` populated during transient empties.

## [4.0.4] — Bug Fixes

### Bug Fixes

- **frontend:** route remote daemon sessions through the peer relay on switch. `useTerminal` built the terminal WS URL from the session `backend` field; the `backend === "daemon"` branch used `/ws/daemon-session?name=...` without `&host=`, so remote daemon sessions hit the hub's LOCAL daemon handler, dialed a local socket for a remote name, failed, and the tab looped "disconnected — reconnecting". Why cmd+R reattached but in-app switch did not: on a fresh page load the sessions list was still fetching when `connect()` first fired, so `backend` was undefined and the else branch (with `&host=`) picked the correct peer-relay route. The WS stayed attached (effect dep is `[sessionName]`). On in-app switch the list was already loaded, `backend="daemon"` was known, and the wrong route was selected. Include `&host=` in the daemon-backend branch when `hostId` is set.

## [4.0.1] – [4.0.3] — Bug Fixes & Performance

### Bug Fixes

- **pty:** clean up orphaned session scopes when their daemon exits out of band. `cleanUpOrphanedSessionScopes_no_function` (best-effort) now runs alongside socket-scan discovery so a crash + later restart does not leave systemd scopes holding zombie processes.
- **session:** reflect daemon death instantly instead of lagging up to 10s. `bridgeSessionWithCB` now calls `RefreshSessions` on teardown so a dead session disappears from the sidebar and its terminal view unmounts promptly.
- **namer:** use `SetDisplayName` for manual rename instead of `ApplyRename`, fixing the AI-name button silently no-oping on remote peer sessions.
- **terminal:** force bracket paste wrapping for multiline pastes when the application hasn't enabled bracket paste mode (DECSET 2004). Before v4 tmux handled this transparently; with direct PTY sessions, apps like Pi that don't enable bracket paste would see each pasted line as a separate Enter.
- **pty:** deduplicate session names on every create, fixing a split-view mirroring bug from missing session name dedup.
- **session:** make new session creation non-blocking — the viewer returns immediately while the daemon cold-starts, instead of stalling on the socket dial.
- **update:** handle "text file busy" (ETXTBSY) when replacing the binary during a self-update by retrying the rename.

### Performance

- **terminal:** increase scrollback to an 8MB ring buffer / 50k line xterm default.

### Frontend Scroll Fixes (v4.0.1 – v4.0.3)

- **terminal:** preserve scroll position on resize instead of forcing `scrollToBottom`; snap to bottom after replay and resize.
- **terminal:** two-phase scroll restore — `requestAnimationFrame` catches xterm async viewport updates the synchronous pass misses.
- **terminal:** settle-timer replay scroll — all panes scroll to bottom after replay.
- **terminal:** scroll-preserve `doFit` and font-load refits now route through the shared `fit()` callback (was bypassing it).
- **terminal:** scroll guard interval reliably keeps terminals at the bottom for ~10s after connect.
- **terminal:** extract shared `fitPreservingScroll`, remove dead scroll code.

## [4.0.0] — Breaking Changes

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **backend:** tmux is no longer required. The daemon PTY backend is now the only session backend. All sessions run as independent daemon processes that survive server crashes, restarts, and OOM events.

### Features

- **daemon:** daemon is now the default and only backend for all sessions
- **daemon:** sessions survive server crashes — each session runs as an independent process with its own process group (`Setsid`)
- **daemon:** automatic session rediscovery on server restart via socket directory scanning
- **daemon:** ring buffer replay — reconnecting clients receive the last 1MB of terminal output

### Session Reliability

- **registry:** verify daemon process is alive (PID check via `/proc`) before removing stale sockets — prevents accidentally orphaning running sessions
- **registry:** increase liveness failure threshold from 3 to 5 consecutive failures for more tolerance under load
- **registry:** mass-removal protection — if all sessions appear stale simultaneously, skip cleanup (likely transient system event)
- **state:** mass-removal guard — refuse to remove >50% of tracked sessions in one update cycle
- **state:** refuse to clear all sessions when discovery returns empty (likely transient failure)
- **daemon:** panic recovery in all daemon goroutines (`pumpPTY`, `handleClient`, accept loop) — a panic in one client connection doesn't crash the daemon
- **daemon:** cap DaemonSession client buffer at 4MB to prevent server OOM from output flooding

### Removed

- **tmux:** removed tmux dependency entirely (2,794 lines deleted)
- **tmux:** removed tmux control mode, session creation, and all tmux-specific code paths
- **recovery:** removed tmux session rebuilder (no longer needed — daemon sessions persist independently)

## [2.2.2](https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2)

### Bug Fixes

- **namer:** make the AI-name button work for remote peer sessions. The name is now generated on the hub (using the remote session's prompt, agent message, project, and sibling names) and sent to the peer to apply, so it no longer silently no-ops when the peer process has no namer configured

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1)

### Bug Fixes

- **namer:** wire distinct names + latest user prompt into the manual regenerate button, which still used the first prompt and ignored sibling names

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard/compare/v2.1.1...v2.2.0)

### Features

- **namer:** make AI session names distinct and current — feed sibling session names into the prompt so labels differ by wording instead of numeric suffixes, name by what differs when sessions share a project/branch/agent, use the latest user prompt for naming (the sidebar still shows the first), re-name on a fresh user prompt, and give reasoning models token headroom by taking the final output line

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.0)

### Performance

- **peer:** make remote sessions hyper-performant — split the control channel into hi/lo priority lanes so bulky state snapshots never block keystroke echoes, ship PTY data as raw binary frames (no base64/JSON per chunk), move marshaling off the single writer, deepen the interactive queue, and raise WebSocket buffers to 32KB. Eliminates typing latency, jitter, and head-of-line blocking on remote peer sessions.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/anh-chu/termyard/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0)

### Features

- **terminal:** add opt-in coding ligature support (Fira Code / JetBrains Mono) via `@xterm/addon-ligatures`, gated behind a Settings → Terminal toggle (default off)

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/ekristen/guppi/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2026-06-13)

### Bug Fixes

- **sidebar:** use !important to ensure selected session text color overrides base ([fbfada9](https://github.com/ekristen/guppi/commit/fbfada9))

## [0.1.1-beta.2](https://github.com/ekristen/guppi/compare/v0.1.0-beta.2...v0.1.1-beta.2) (2026-03-15)

- better font/size ([a607c16](https://github.com/ekristen/guppi/commit/a607c162761eac26e2dec4eaebf637d07b0cca61))
